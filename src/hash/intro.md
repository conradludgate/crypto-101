# Hash Functions

A hash function takes an input set of bytes and outputs a 'digest' set of bytes.
The digest is always the same if the input is the same. For a cryptographic hash,
the reverse operation from digest to input is not possible.

## Randomness

The digest of a hash function is pseudo-random.
